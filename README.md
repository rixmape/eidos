# Eidos: Examining Beliefs Through Dialogue

## Problem Statement

Many individuals hold beliefs without fully examining their foundations or considering alternative viewpoints. This lack of critical examination can lead to inconsistencies in thought, hindering personal growth and understanding. Traditional methods of learning often do not provide the personalized, interactive feedback necessary for deep philosophical inquiry.

## Proposed Solution

Eidos is a web application designed to engage users in a dialogue using the Socratic method. This approach encourages users to articulate their beliefs, confront inconsistencies, and consider alternative perspectives. By simulating a personalized philosophical conversation, Eidos aims to deepen the user's understanding and refine their beliefs.

## Key Features

- Engages users in deep discussions to explore their beliefs.
- Helps find and reflect on any inconsistencies in their beliefs.
- Introduces other viewpoints for comparison.
- Adapts conversations to individual user responses.
- Uses philosophical texts for factual references.
