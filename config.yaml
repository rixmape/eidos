  #### How does it work?

  Eidos helps you share your beliefs, spot contradictions, and consider other views by using the Socratic Method. This method involves asking questions and having discussions.

templates:
  greeting: |
    What's something you believe to be true about {topic}?

  system: |
    Assume the role of a philosopher. We are exchanging SMS messages using the Socratic method. Help me understand my beliefs, address their inconsistencies, and consider other perspectives. If I stray from philosophy, gently guide me back to the original topic.

    {instructions}

  rag_route: |
    Given a message, determine whether reading philosophical texts is necessary to generate a response. A message requires philosophical texts if it mentions a concept, argument, or philosopher that you think requires further explanation.

    If it requires texts, reply `fetch documents`. If not, reply `continue conversation`. Respond with these exact phrases. Do not include the backticks.

    Here's the message you need to consider:

    ```
    {user_message}
    ```

  context: |
    Before replying, read and understand the texts below. Use them in the conversation if they relate to my last message. If not, use your own knowledge to lead the conversation.

    {context}

  query_expansion: |
    Rewrite my last message to add context and depth relevant to our conversation. Do not answer the last message directly. Instead, expand it only. The revision should have more details that were not initially mentioned. Finally, conclude with 20 specific keywords or jargons related to the expanded content.

    Format your response as follows:

    ```
    <EXPANDED_MESSAGE>

    <KEYWORD_1>, <KEYWORD_2>, ..., <KEYWORD_20>
    ```

  quality: |
    Analyze the given reply to identify any inconsistencies. These include logical fallacies, unsupported claims, and internal contradictions. If you find any, specify which area is inconsistent and provide a brief explanation. If the reply is consistent, explain the statement's logical coherence.

    Here's the reply you need to consider:

    ```
    {user_message}
    ```

  question_consistent: |
    In writing your reply, consider this statement:

    ```
    {user_message}
    ```

    {statement_quality}

    Your task is to generate a question that targets the parts of user's thinking. Here are some sample questions:

    - On what information are you basing that comment?
    - What experience convinced you of this?
    - Could you explain your reasoning?
    - What exactly are you taking for granted here?
    - Why are you assuming that? Shouldn't we rather assume that…?
    - What are you implying when you say…?
    - If we do this, what is likely to happen as a result?
    - Is there another point of view we should consider?

    Choose one of these questions or create your own.

  question_inconsistent: |

    - Could you give me more details about that?
    - How could we check that to see if it is true?
    - I don't see how what you said bears on the question. Could you show me how it is relevant?
    - Could you explain what you think the connection is between your statement and the question we have focused on?
    - What points of view are relevant to this issue?
    - What relevant points of view have I ignored thus far?

    Choose one of these questions or create your own.
