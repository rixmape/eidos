This study aims to overcome the challenges of implementing the Socratic method.
I introduce an AI-driven chatbot, assuming the role of a facilitator. Powered by a large language model (LLM), Eidos is designed to understand the linguistic nuances in a conversation. This allows it to guide discussions effectively, ensuring that participants are engaged and not overwhelmed. For enhanced inclusivity, a user can configure certain aspects of the chatbot such as language complexity and dialogue pace. This ensures that users of varying levels of preparation and background knowledge can respond meaningfully. Furthermore, Eidos is equipped with a database of philosophical texts, obtained from online public repositories, that can be referenced during the conversation to provide factual information and support the arguments made. By automating the facilitation process, Eidos seeks to make philosophical inquiry more accessible and engaging.
