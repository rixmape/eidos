## Introduction

The Socratic method is a form of dialogue, which follows a question-and-answer format. It refines beliefs through systematic questioning, inductive reasoning, and universal definitions (Overholser, 1993). The aim is to achieve doxastic coherence or a state where beliefs are consistent and logically sound (Benson, 2009). During the process, a participant shares a belief and the facilitator highlights any inconsistencies, ultimately driving the participant to refine their belief. The Socratic method has made pedagogical contributions by enhancing critical thinking skills of learners (Dalim, 2022; Ho et al., 2023; Abou-Hanna et al., 2021). It enables a shift from traditional didactic teaching to a more explorative and dialogic learning environment (Delić & Bećirović, 2016).

While the method is highly regarded, it comes with practical challenges. One issue is the need for a facilitator who can guide participants without overwhelming them (Crogman et al., 2015). Questioning techniques must complement diverse learning styles and background knowledge (Dalim, 2022; Riffel, 2014; Vincent Hogshead, 2017). Participants should also possess a good vocabulary to contribute meaningful feedback (Chan & Zahar, 2012). Extra support is required for participants who lack preparation or sufficient background knowledge (Copelin, 2017). In addition, all individuals need significant knowledge of the subject to respond accurately to questions (Al-Darwish, 2012). All these underscore the imperative to rethink how the Socratic method is implemented, especially in the context of modern education.

Eidos, an AI-driven chatbot, offers a solution by providing an inclusive and engaging space for Socratic dialogues. This study particularly focuses on improving three key aspects: (1) facilitators' questioning skills, (2) participants' diverse backgrounds, and (3) refining beliefs by identifying inconsistencies. For each dimension, Eidos puts forward innovative solutions. First, it uses a large language model (LLM) to understand the ongoing dialogue and generate relevant responses. Second, it allows users to customize the chatbot to match their preferences. Lastly, Eidos follows a structured approach to identify belief inconsistencies and guide participants to reach a more refined understanding.

At the core of Eidos is an LLM, which generates human-like text by learning from extensive training data (Floridi & Chiriatti, 2020). Recent advancements in artificial intelligence enable LLMs to understand the relationship between words in a sentence, regardless of their sequence (Devlin et al., 2018; Vaswani et al., 2017). This ability is similar to a person reading a book while connecting information from both previous and succeeding pages. In education, LLMs have been used to create interactive learning tools and explain complex concepts (Dijkstra et al., 2022; MacNeil et al., 2022). Applied to Eidos, the LLM serves as the main engine to comprehend the context and nuances of the conversation, paving the way for coherent and engaging experience.

Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs further, prompt engineering is employed to fine-tune the chatbot's responses. This involves finding the most appropriate instruction for an LLM to solve the task at hand (Liu et al., 2023). Effective adoption of prompt engineering requires experimentation with different prompt patterns such as role playing, chain-of-thought, and template filling (White et al., 2023). Eidos primarily uses this technique to generate responses that replicates a facilitator's questioning style. Combined with the LLM's ability to understand the context, Eidos can provide tailored responses that align with the user's background knowledge and learning preferences.

Identifying inconsistencies is the most crucial task of Eidos. To achieve this, the chatbot determines its action based on a model of the Socratic method. The model is developed from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which aims to improve the factuality of the generated responses by retrieving information from external sources (Gao et al., 2023). In the case of Eidos, the chatbot is connected to a database of publicly available articles from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Eidos uses these articles to cross-reference the user's belief and identify any inconsistencies. On the other hand, dialogue routing ensures that the chatbot follows a structured approach to guide the conversation. Additionaly, Eidos uses its pre-trained knowledge to check for inconsistencies while considering several dimensions, such as internal contradiction, logical fallacies, and factual inaccuracies.
