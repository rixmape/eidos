## Introduction

This section answers the following questions:

- What is the Socratic method?
- How it can help in examining beliefs?
- Why it can be challenging to adopt this method?
- How does Eidos solve these challenges?

The Socratic method is a philosophical technique that involves a question-and-answer style of dialogue. It originates from the conversations Socrates had in Plato's dialogues, where he questioned people to challenge their beliefs. The method starts with someone offering a definition for a concept. Socrates then points out any inconsistencies. The other person attempts to address these inconsistencies with a better definition, and this process repeats. Although these dialogues often don't end with a clear definition, they help clarify what the concept isn't, moving the interlocoutors closer to the truth. From here on, I will refer to the person who poses questions as the facilitator and the person who responds as the participant.

This method is valued for helping individuals refine their beliefs by addressing and correcting inconsistencies. It relies on systematic questioning, inductive reasoning, and seeking universal definitions to expose flaws in beliefs (Overholser, 1993). Socratic dialogues is often embraced to improve the critical thinking skills of participants (Dalim, 2022; Ho et al., 2023; Abou-Hanna et al., 2021; Boa, 2018). Inside the classroom, a facilitator uses the method to prompt participants to express and then examine their understanding of a topic. This forces participants to think on the spot and respond precisely (Porter, 2015). Beyond asking questions, the Socratic method also helps participants assess the validity of their arguments (Acim, 2018).

While the Socratic method is highly regarded, it comes with practical challenges. A significant issue is finding a facilitator who can guide discussions effectively without overwhelming participants (Crogman et al, 2015). Adapting questioning techniques to accommodate diverse learning styles is crucial (Dalim, 2022; Riffel, 2014; Vincent Hogshead, 2017). Facilitators also need deep knowledge on the subject to respond accurately to questions (Al-Darwish, 2012). However, challenges aren't limited to facilitators; participants face obstacles too. Participants who lack of preparation or insufficient background knowledge requires facilitators to provide extra support (Copelin, 2017). Participants should also possess a good vocabulary to contribute meaningful responses (Chan & Zahar, 2012). All these underscore the clear need to modify the approach to be more inclusive and engaging for all participants.

This study introduces Eidos, an AI-driven chatbot designed to facilitate Socratic dialogues. Eidos is powered by a large language model (LLM) to understand linguistic nuances in each conversation. It offers customizable settings for language complexity and dialogue pace, ensuring that users of varying levels of background knowledge can engage meaningfully. Furthermore, Eidos enriches conversations with factual information from a database of philosophical texts. By automating the facilitation process, Eidos aims to make philosophical inquiry more accessible and engaging.
