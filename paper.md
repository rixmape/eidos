# Eidos: Examining Beliefs Through Dialogue

## Introduction

### The Socratic Method in Education

The Socratic method is a dialectical approach to inquiry that follows a question-and-answer format (Soccio 104). Demonstrated by Socrates in Plato's dialogues, this method was a tool for engaging Athenians to challenge their own beliefs. It aims to assess the coherence and support of a belief system (Benson 6). The process generally involves three steps: first, the individual presents a belief; then, Socrates asks questions to examine the belief's depth and implications; finally, both parties refine the belief to achieve a justified and coherent understanding. This iterative questioning and refining process encourages individuals to not just hold beliefs but to understand the reasoning behind them.

Employing the method has proven to significantly enhance critical thinking skills in diverse educational settings. For example, Socratic seminars provide students with a platform for intellectual analysis to avoid taking statements at face value (Acim 49). The method's focus on logic and clarity further improves analytical abilities when combined with practical learning exercises (Ho et al. 14). It has also been shown to boost communication skills, making students more confident in expressing their thoughts (Dalim et al. 1039). In addition, it was found that students value thought-provoking questions more than teachers realize, suggesting that the Socratic method should not be abandoned (Abou-Hanna et al. 114). All of these findings highlight the method's role in encouraging learners to question assumptions and engage deeply with content.

However, applying the Socratic method in different educational settings presents challenges. For instance, in language teaching and science education, obstacles such as teachers' lack of content knowledge and questioning skills have been identified (Dalim et al., 1040). These challenges underline the importance of professional training for teachers to effectively use the Socratic method. Without skilled teachers, students may feel intimidated that they resist learning (Crogman 70). Additionally, extra support must be provided as the method's success partly depends on the students' background knowledge and vocabulary (Copelin 4-5; Chan & Zahar 8). When thoughtfully applied, the Socratic method has the power to transform learning experiences.

### Enhancing the Socratic Method with AI

Eidos innovates artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the Socratic method's application in education. This tool is crafted to complement teachers by adapting to diverse student backgrounds, ultimately aiming to make philosophical inquiry accessible and engaging for all. Eidos addresses three challenges: it uses natural language processing (NLP) to generate relevant responses, overcoming limitations in teachers' questioning skills; it offers customization options to cater to individual learning preferences, ensuring a broader inclusivity; and it uses a structured approach to identify inconsistencies in students' beliefs, promoting critical thinking and self-reflection. Through these measures, Eidos provides a platform where students can prepare to tackle the modern world through philosophical inquiry.

At the core of Eidos is OpenAI's GPT-4, a large language model (LLM) that excels in generating context-aware, human-like text. This technology is made possible by recent advancements in NLP that allow LLMs to understand nuanced language patterns (Devlin 2; Vaswani 5). Its proficiency in various NLP tasks such as question-answering and information extraction makes it a powerful tool for educational applications (Kalyan 13, 26; Dijkstra 4; MacNeil 37). Additionally, GPT-4's knowledge from its extensive training data allows it to identify internal contradictions and logical fallacies in students' claims, providing opportunity to improve their logical coherence. However, its limitations, such as reasoning errors and producing inaccurate content, require further solutions from Eidos (Achiam et al. 46).

Prompt engineering, a technique in using LLMs, is embraced to fine-tune Eidos' behavior. This technique provides the LLM with the most appropriate instruction for solving the task at hand (Liu et al. 22). By prompting the LLM to generate responses in a step-by-step manner, Eidos can mitigate the risk of making reasoning errors. Prompt engineering is also applied to adapt Eidos' questioning style with the students' learning preferences. For example, LLMs can be prompted to generate responses that uses standard English instead of academic-level language to cater to students with different language proficiency levels. Effective adoption of this technique requires experimentation with different prompt patterns such as role playing, chain-of-thought, and template filling (White et al., 4).

The tendency of LLMs to provide false information is addressed by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a technique that bridges knowledge gap by incorporating a database of external information (Gao et al. 2). In Eidos, publicly available articles from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) is used to ground the factuality of the LLM's responses. This approach allows the model to avoid sharing unsupported claims and instead provide accurate and reliable information. Furthermore, Eidos cross-references the user's belief with the SEP articles to identify external contradictions to established philosophical knowledge. This process ensures that the user's belief is consistent with commonly accepted truths and encourages them to refine their understanding.

The subsequent sections of this paper will detail the design, development, and evaluation of Eidos, providing an in-depth analysis of its methodology and application. By addressing the design choices, development processes, and evaluation methods, this examination aims to illuminate the transformative potential of Eidos in overcoming the traditional challenges associated with the Socratic method. The significance of this study lies not only in its immediate impact on enhancing educational technology but also in its broader implications for the future of philosophical inquiry, offering a forward-looking perspective on how technology can enrich critical thinking and dialogic learning in the digital age.

## Methods

### Design

The Socratic Method Model detailed in Figure 1 is a sophisticated framework designed to engage users in philosophical dialogue. The model initiates a conversation by requesting the user to articulate a belief, which is then received and processed to ensure the dialogue remains within a predefined limit of exchanges. A limit is set to reduce the number of API calls since the LLM is computationally expensive. This structured approach progresses through a series of steps where the AI, depending on whether the user's belief contains philosophical concepts, either references philosophical texts or moves directly to identify inconsistencies. The philosophical texts include public article from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The model is dynamic, allowing for deeper exploration into the user's belief system by encouraging defense of their beliefs or requesting clarifications to highlight and rectify inconsistencies.

At the heart of this model lies the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, which equips the LLM with the capability to access a vast repository of philosophical texts. This enables the LLM to conduct a more informed analysis of the user's beliefs by referencing established philosophical knowledge. The RAG architecture not only enhances the AI‚Äôs ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses but also significantly improves the identification of inconsistencies within the user‚Äôs beliefs. By leveraging this architecture, the model ensures that the dialogue is both informative and reflective.

To effectively identify inconsistencies in the user's belief system, the LLM employs a meticulous approach that examines internal contradictions, inconsistencies with other beliefs, and inconsistencies with established knowledge. It checks for direct and implicit contradictions within the belief itself and against the user's broader belief system. Additionally, it evaluates the belief against established scientific, historical, and evidence-based information to identify any misalignments. This thorough examination is essential for fostering a deeper understanding and refining the user's beliefs, guiding them towards a more coherent and logically sound belief system. Through this process, Eidos demonstrates a profound capacity for facilitating meaningful philosophical inquiry, offering a novel and interactive way to engage with complex concepts and self-reflection.

### Development

#### Software Architecture

The Eidos project's software architecture is structured around a central core, the Main Application Logic (`main.py`), which orchestrates the interplay among various components critical to its operation. This central orchestrator controls the flow of the application, ensuring seamless integration and coordination between different modules. Key modules include Configuration (`1_‚ú®_Configuration.py` and `configuration.py`), responsible for setting up and initializing the application's environment and parameters; the Chat Interface (`2_ü§ñ_Chat.py` and `chatbot.py`), which manages the AI-driven dialogues with users; the Survey Mechanism (`3_üìù_Survey.py` and `survey.py`), tasked with collecting and analyzing user feedback; Utility Services (`page_utils.py`), offering common functionalities across the application; and Document Management (`document_manager.py`), handling the retrieval of philosophical texts from external sources. These components work in concert to facilitate a dynamic and interactive user experience, grounded in the Socratic method of inquiry.

Underpinning the chat interface are AI Language Models that process user inputs and generate dialogues, simulating the Socratic method to encourage users to examine and articulate their beliefs. External Databases, such as the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, are integrated via the Document Management module, enriching dialogues with authoritative references and supporting the application's educational objectives. Data Analysis Tools analyze feedback collected through the Survey Mechanism, informing continuous improvement and personalization of the user experience. Overall, the software architecture of Eidos is designed for flexibility, scalability, and robustness, ensuring that the application can adapt to the evolving needs of its users while maintaining a focus on fostering philosophical exploration and personal growth.

#### LLM Agents

The Large Language Model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT-4, is a pivotal component in the Eidos software architecture, facilitating a range of functionalities that enable the application to simulate sophisticated philosophical dialogues. As the backbone of Eidos's AI-driven interaction, the LLM undertakes multiple roles through prompt engineering, a method used to guide the AI's responses to align with the desired outcomes. First, as a Question-Answering Agent, it processes user messages within the context of the entire chat history, orchestrating the sequence of interactions and deciding when to engage other agents. This includes calling upon the Dialogue Router Agent to navigate the conversation's direction based on the user's current inputs, ensuring the dialogue remains relevant and insightful.

Within its diversified roles, the LLM further acts as a Dialogue Router Agent, determining the necessity of incorporating philosophical texts into the conversation, thereby enriching the dialogue with deeper insights into mentioned concepts, arguments, or philosophers. As a Query Translation Agent, it expands on user messages to create pseudo-documents that facilitate the retrieval of pertinent philosophical texts from the database, using vector similarity to find the most relevant texts. Finally, in its role as a Conversation Summary Agent, the LLM synthesizes the conversation into a comprehensive summary, highlighting key points discussed, which is particularly useful when a dialogue reaches its pre-defined message limit. Through these roles, the LLM exemplifies the application's capability to provide an interactive, educational experience, leveraging the vast knowledge embedded within GPT-4 to foster philosophical inquiry and reflection.

#### Knowledge Database

The Eidos project leverages a knowledge database comprised of articles from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), selectively incorporating those that are publicly available through a process of web scraping. This methodical aggregation of philosophical content forms the foundation upon which Eidos enriches its dialogues, allowing the application to draw upon a wide array of philosophical theories, arguments, and biographies of notable philosophers to support the exploration of complex topics within conversations. Users engaging with the platform can directly see which texts from the SEP are referenced during their interactions, ensuring transparency and educational value. Moreover, all references made to these texts are properly cited, adhering to academic standards and fostering a culture of respect for intellectual property and scholarly work.

Hosting this meticulously curated database is Pinecone, a vector database provider that specializes in handling complex, semantic search queries through vector embeddings. By leveraging Pinecone's capabilities, Eidos can efficiently cross-reference user inputs with its database of philosophical texts, identifying the most relevant articles based on vector similarity. This approach enables a dynamic and contextually relevant injection of philosophical insights into dialogues, significantly enhancing the depth and educational quality of the interactions. Pinecone's vector database technology not only facilitates rapid and accurate retrieval of information but also scales with the application, supporting the expanding repository of knowledge as more articles are added. This integration exemplifies how cutting-edge database technologies can be employed to bridge AI-driven dialogue systems with extensive, domain-specific knowledge bases, enriching user experiences with meaningful and informed content.

#### User Interface

The user interface of Eidos is crafted using Streamlit, a powerful Python package renowned for its ability to rapidly transform Python scripts into interactive web applications. This choice is motivated by the need for swift prototyping, enabling the developers to quickly iterate on the application's design and functionality to meet the project's evolving requirements. Streamlit's straightforward integration and ease of use allow for the seamless incorporation of complex AI functionalities into a user-friendly interface, facilitating engaging and deep philosophical dialogues.

In designing the user experience (UX) for Eidos, several key considerations were made to ensure that users find the application both enlightening and easy to navigate. First, the clarity of the dialogue interface was prioritized, ensuring that users can easily follow the conversation flow, input their thoughts, and understand the AI-generated responses. This includes the thoughtful organization of chat history and the clear presentation of philosophical references and summaries. Second, the responsiveness of the application was optimized, guaranteeing users receive timely feedback to their inquiries and interactions, which is critical in maintaining engagement in a dialogue-intensive environment. Lastly, accessibility was emphasized, with efforts made to ensure that the application is inclusive and usable by a diverse audience, including those with varying levels of familiarity with philosophical discourse and digital literacy. These UX considerations are pivotal in making the exploration of complex philosophical ideas through Eidos not only possible but also a delightful and enriching experience.

#### Data Management

For the Eidos project, data management is handled using Firebase Firestore, a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform. Firestore is chosen for its real-time data synchronization capabilities, allowing for instant updates across user sessions, which is essential for a dynamic application like Eidos that involves continuous user interaction. The database stores critical information such as users' chat histories and their responses to survey forms, enabling a personalized and continuous dialogue experience.

Storing chat histories allows Eidos to maintain context in ongoing conversations, facilitating a more coherent and engaging interaction that builds upon previous exchanges. This is crucial for the application's ability to conduct meaningful dialogues that evolve over time. Survey responses, on the other hand, provide valuable feedback on the user experience, offering insights into how users perceive the application and how it can be improved. Additionally, this data collection supports the development team in understanding user engagement and identifying areas for enhancement, driving the iterative improvement of Eidos. The use of Firestore for data management underscores the project's commitment to leveraging advanced technologies to ensure a seamless, efficient, and user-centric platform.

### Evaluation

The evaluation of Eidos centers on its efficacy in fostering philosophical inquiry and enhancing users' critical engagement with their beliefs. To systematically assess the application, the study deployed a mixed-methods approach, leveraging both quantitative and qualitative data gleaned from the integrated survey module post-interaction. Quantitative measures were derived from Likert-scale questions focusing on the application's impact on critical thinking, openness to alternative perspectives, and the identification of inconsistencies in users' beliefs. Concurrently, qualitative insights were harvested from open-ended responses and multiple-choice questions, providing depth and context to the numerical data. This comprehensive evaluation framework allowed for a nuanced understanding of Eidos's performance across diverse user experiences.

Initial findings from the quantitative analysis indicated a positive trend, with a majority of users agreeing that Eidos effectively aided in examining their beliefs more critically and in considering alternative viewpoints. The qualitative responses complemented these findings, with users frequently highlighting the value of engaging in Socratic dialogues and the referencing of philosophical texts as significant contributors to their reflective process. Specifically, anecdotes of moments where Eidos identified inconsistencies in their beliefs underscored the application's capability to provoke deeper introspection. However, feedback on areas for improvement pointed to a desire for enhanced AI understanding of complex beliefs and more sensitive handling of topics, suggesting avenues for further development.

The evaluation also illuminated the pivotal role of the survey form in iterating upon Eidos's design and functionality. User suggestions for more diverse and personalized dialogue experiences have prompted ongoing refinements to the AI model and content database. By aligning with user feedback, the project underscores a commitment to continuous improvement, ensuring that Eidos remains a dynamic and responsive platform for philosophical exploration. Future evaluations will incorporate a broader dataset and explore longitudinal impacts on users' philosophical engagement, aiming to substantiate the initial positive trends and address the constructive critiques highlighted by the user community.
